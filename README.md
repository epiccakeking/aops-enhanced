## Modifying

If you would like to make modifications your userscript extension should have an option to do so. If you plan on sharing your modified userscript with  others, please fork this repository and give people the link to your fork instead (do add indication it is a fork in the userscript name though). This is to make it easier for others to use and get support for your particular version of the userscript.
